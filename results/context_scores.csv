given, or were dedicated by the Swami, to the purposes of the Math which was a
charitable or religious institution.",tensor(0.3775)

that even if this be so the trust was not for public, but for private, purposes.",tensor(0.5879)

the Math to worship the Swami and take food there.",tensor(0.7782)

public purposes.",tensor(0.6386)

donor.",tensor(0.6083)

Swami for the purpose of the Math.",tensor(0.3622)

received many gifts of property for charitable purposes does not disqualify him from
receiving gifts for his own personal benefit, and their Lordships think that this small

and not a public charitable trust, and the plaintiffs were also not ‘persons interested’ in the trust.",tensor(0.4844)
"Therein, for the purpose of constructing a building on a plot of land belonging to defendant society
and develop it, a board of five trustees was set up by the standing committee of the defendant society
through a registered trust deed dated 01.09.1975 where the President of the defendant society was
the Managing Trustee.",tensor(0.4883)
"However, the trust was revoked almost two years later since the construction
was complete and the purposes for which it had been set up was fulfilled.",tensor(0.5783)

High Court emphasized that Section 5 of the Societies Registration Act, 1860 cannot be construed to
mean that the governing body members of the society would automatically become trustees if no
trust is created to manage the assets of the society.",tensor(0.7345)

Society, constituted a trust on 01.09.1975 for the purpose of constructing upon a plot
of land allotted to it in 1962.",tensor(0.6601)
"This was part of the avowed objectives that govern the
Society.",tensor(0.6313)
"The AIWC had resolved that after construction, the building would be
utilized to provide housing for as many working women as was feasible and also at
the same time generate rental income to sustain its other welfare activities.",tensor(0.6433)
"The
plaintiffs allege various acts of financial irregularities in relation to construction
activity undertaken by the AIWC as well as alleged acts of embezzlement on part of
the Treasurer.",tensor(0.5045)
"They also rely upon certain observations by the AIWC's Chartered
Accountants or Auditors.",tensor(0.5245)

some time and are, therefore, 'interested for its proper management and functioning'.",tensor(0.7501)

building.",tensor(0.8346)
"Apparently, after that objective was achieved, the Trust was dissolved or

"In view of the above discussion, the Court is of opinion that the suit is not maintainable, because
two crucial ingredients, which are essential pre-requisites for action under Section 92 are lacking;
the first, defendant is a society, and not a public charitable Trust.",tensor(0.7331)

"The High
Court accepted such a contention and leave to institute a suit under Section 92 was granted by
delineating the following:
i.",tensor(0.5662)
"First, emphasis was laid on several Articles of the Memorandum of Association of
the defendant society of which one provided that certain properties were indeed held
in trust by the defendant society on behalf of the member YMCAs.",tensor(0.3869)
"Furthermore, the historical background indicated that the defendant society started
administering and looking after existing member YMCAs which were formed even
before it was registered as a society, quite similar to the factual scenario in Kesava
Panicker (supra).",tensor(0.3121)
"The defendant society was not only holding properties in trust but
also exercised the power to enter into transactions in respect of such properties.",tensor(0.2204)
"On a
consideration of all the above, it was held that there remained no doubt that the
defendant society was in both ‘express’ and ‘constructive’ trust of the properties
belonging to its members.",tensor(0.4311)
ii.,tensor(0.7676)
"Secondly, by interpreting Section 3 of the Indian Trusts Act, 1882, the elements
that were required to be fulfilled for an express or constructive trust were said to be –
(a) ownership of a property, (b) a confidence reposed by the owner, and (c) the said
confidence being accepted for the benefit of another.",tensor(0.5191)
"It was stated that if these
elements are satisfied a trust could be said to be created.",tensor(0.4018)
"It was, however
acknowledged that the term “express or constructive trust” in Section 92 of the CPC
does not relate to a trust constituted under the Indian Trust Act, 1882 but any body
or entity which holds in trust any property and is created for public purposes of a
religious or charitable nature.",tensor(0.4583)
